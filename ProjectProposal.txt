Summary:
I will make a language testing app
* that requires users to enter grammatical correct stories or sentences (in their base language)
-> the input is separated into sentences
-> the user is presented with the first sentence in their base language and all of the words for the sentence in the foreign language
-> the user must select the words in the foreign language in the correct order that creates their base language sentence
-> then the next sentence in the story will appear or a completed! notification

** based on time to complete the above application 
- I might add an option for a one word direct translation: given some words chage meaning in sentences. 
- I might add a scoring system for people to compare scores on stories. 
- I might do an email invite to friends to try a certain story translation. 
- I might make pagination of the login home page to view more stories in the database there. 
- I might make a search option for the stories. 

1. What goal will your website be designed to achieve?
The website will be used to test and improve foreign language understanding. 

2. What kind of users will visit your site? In other words, what is the demographic of
your users?
The demographic includes anyone wanting to learn or test their proficiency of a language and knows how to use a computer. I imagine the main target would be high school to college students. 

3. What data do you plan on using? You may have not picked your actual API yet,
which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain.
I will use the google translate API. 

4. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not
know everything in advance and that these details might change later). 
Answer questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information:
a. What does your database schema look like?
TranslateDatabse:
- user table with login info and password encryption
- story table with translation from google
- tag table with tag words for stories, so that people may search for stories by tags
- users_stories table with score/completion information
- tags_stories table matching one tag to many stories and one story to many tags

b. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API?
I hope that I don't have issues making too many requests. 

c. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
No - but I will have logins with users so that progress can be saved. 

d. What functionality will your app include?
The app will be mainly for review of language translation. It will be hard for someone with no experience in the foreign language to use this app solely to learn. I view this as a supplemtal app to something like Duolingo. 

e. What will the user flow look like?
Home Page with app description and prompts to login or signup
-> login page home: shows list of current OR most used translation stories
-> with updated NAV bar options: create new, view other users, view my previous translations

f. What features make your site more than CRUD? Do you have any stretch
goals?
More than CRUD: user login, integration of Google API
** stretch goals in the based on time completion section above.
